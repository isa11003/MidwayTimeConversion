# MidwayTimeConversion

The function convertTimeToWords can be found within the file convertTimeToWords.js

There is another file called testMidwayProgram.html, this file has a crude way of testing all the test cases that were found in the .csv file, simply click the button and it will run the tests. 

In order to run the tests you will need to download both files into the same directory, open the html page in a browser, and click the button.

if desired the inputs can be changed from the original test cases by changing the number of minutes or hours
